            <description>In its policy, the European Union intervenes when necessary to prevent conflict or in response to emerging or actual crises. In certain cases, EU intervention can take the form of restrictive measures or 'sanctions'. The application of financial sanctions and more precisely the freezing of assets constitutes an obligation for both the public and private sector. In this regard, a particular responsibility falls on credit and financial institutions, since they are involved in the bulk of financial transfers.&#13;
&#13;
In order to facilitate the application of financial sanctions, the European Banking Federation, the European Savings Banks Group, the European Association of Co-operative Banks, the European Association of Public Banks ("the EU Credit Sector Federations") and the European Commission recognised the need for an EU consolidated list of persons, groups and entities subject to financial sanctions and more precisely the freezing of assets. The Credit Sector Federations set up an initial database containing the consolidated list. The European Commission subsequently took over this database and is responsible for its maintenance and for keeping the consolidated list of sanctions up-to-date. In this respect, the Service for Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI) of the European Commission launched a new Web page in June 2017, where the consolidated lists of financial sanctions consisting in freezing of assets are published in different formats (see link below).&#13;
&#13;
Disclaimer: While every effort is made to ensure that the database and the consolidated list correctly reproduce all relevant data of the officially adopted texts published in the Official Journal of the European Union, neither the Commission nor the EU Credit Sector Federations accepts any liability for possible omissions of relevant data or mistakes, and nor for any use the database or of the consolidated list. Only the information published in the Official Journal of the EU is deemed authentic. </description>
