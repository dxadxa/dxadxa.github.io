    <dcterms:description xml:lang="en">The EC inventory published below is a copy as received from the JRC in 2008 on the founding of ECHA.   &#13;
It is comprised of the following lists:   &#13;
&#13;
* EINECS (European INventory of Existing Commercial chemical Substances) as published in O.J. C 146A, 15.6.1990.  EINECS is an inventory of substances that were deemed to be on the European Community market between 1 January 1971 and 18 September 1981. EINECS was drawn up by the European Commission in the application of Article 13 of Directive 67/548/EEC, as amended by Directive 79/831/EEC, and in accordance with the detailed provisions of Commission Decision 81/437/EEC. Substances listed in EINECS are considered phase-in substances under the REACH Regulation.   &#13;
&#13;
* ELINCS (European LIst of Notified Chemical Substances) in support of Directive 92/32/EEC, the 7th amendment to Directive 67/548/EEC.  ELINCS lists those substances which were notified under Directive 67/548/EEC, the Dangerous Substances Directive Notification of New Substances (NONS) that became commercially available after 18 September 1981.   &#13;
&#13;
* NLP (No-Longer Polymers).  The definition of polymers was changed in April 1992 by Council Directive 92/32/EEC amending Directive 67/548/EEC, with the result that substances previously considered to be polymers were no longer excluded from regulation. Thus the No-longer Polymers (NLP) list was drawn up, consisting of such substances that were commercially available between 18 September 1981 and 31 October 1993.</dcterms:description>
